# Beginner Level — SOC Foundations

## What you will learn
By the end of this level, you should understand:
- What a SOC does day to day
- What SIEM and SOAR actually mean in practice
- How alerts become incidents
- Why humans are still critical in security operations

---

## 1. What is a SOC?
A **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is a team responsible for:
- Monitoring security alerts
- Investigating suspicious activity
- Responding to incidents
- Protecting the organization 24/7

Think of the SOC as the **control room** for cybersecurity.

---

## 2. What is SIEM?
**SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**:
- Collects logs from many systems
- Correlates events
- Generates alerts

Key idea:
> SIEM tells you **something happened**, not **what to do next**.

---

## 3. What is an Alert?
An alert is:
- A signal that *might* indicate malicious activity
- Often noisy
- Not always a real incident

Most alerts are **false positives**.

---

## 4. What is an Incident?
An incident is:
- A confirmed security issue
- Requires response
- Tracked and documented

Not every alert becomes an incident.

---

## 5. What is SOAR?
**SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)**:
- Automates repetitive SOC tasks
- Enforces consistent response
- Reduces analyst fatigue

SOAR helps analysts move **faster**, not think **less**.

---

## 6. Why Humans Are Still Needed
Automation cannot:
- Understand business context
- Make risk trade-offs
- Take responsibility

SOAR supports humans — it does not replace them.

---

## What’s next?
You’re ready to learn:
- How investigations work
- How playbooks are designed
- How decisions are automated safely
