# Advanced Level — SOAR Design & Governance

## What you will learn
By the end of this level, you should understand:
- How to design safe playbooks
- How governance works
- How SOAR is evaluated by leadership
- Why some automation is intentionally slow

---

## 1. SOAR Is a Risk System
Every automated action carries risk.

SOAR design must balance:
- Speed
- Accuracy
- Business impact

---

## 2. Playbook Design Principles
Good playbooks are:
- Narrow in scope
- Explicit in decisions
- Observable and auditable

Avoid “one playbook to rule them all”.

---

## 3. Governance & Approvals
Governance includes:
- Who can change playbooks
- Who approves automation
- How failures are handled

This is critical in regulated environments.

---

## 4. Metrics That Matter
Leadership cares about:
- Mean Time To Detect (MTTD)
- Mean Time To Respond (MTTR)
- False positive reduction
- Analyst workload

SOAR must improve **people outcomes**, not just metrics.

---

## 5. When NOT to Automate
Do not automate when:
- The cost of failure is high
- Context is unclear
- Human judgment is essential

Mature SOCs automate **less**, but better.

---

## 6. The Reality of Production SOAR
In real environments:
- Playbooks evolve slowly
- Changes are reviewed
- Stability matters more than novelty

SOAR is engineering, not experimentation.

---

## What’s next?
You’re ready to:
- Review real playbooks
- Design automation safely
- Mentor junior analysts
